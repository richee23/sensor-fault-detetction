Problem Statement


The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads , slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air. 
This is Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

Solution Proposed 

In this project, the system in focus is the Air Pressure System (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilised in various function in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific componenet of the APS System.
The problem is due to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So its required to miniize the false predicitins.
